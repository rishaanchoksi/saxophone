      <p class="baritext"><b> The baritone saxophone is a member of the saxophone family of instruments, larger than the tenor saxophone,
           but smaller than the bass. It is the lowest-pitched saxophone in common use - the bass, contrabass and subcontrabass saxophones
            are relatively uncommon. Like all saxophones, it is a single-reed instrument.

    <p class="baritext"><b>The soprano and baritone saxophones have a few more issues that a beginner will face. Although the soprano 
      is smaller than the others, it is very difficult to play in tune. At least for the first little while. The baritone is very big 
      and so will require more air.</b></p>
