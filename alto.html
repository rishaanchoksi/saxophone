      <p class="altotext"><b> The alto saxophone, also referred to as the alto sax or simply the alto, is a member of the saxophone 
          family of woodwind instruments. Invented by Belgian instrument designer Adolphe Sax in the 1840s and patented in 1846, it is 
          pitched in Eâ™­ and smaller than the tenor but larger than the soprano.

    <p class="altotext"><b> The alto saxophone is easier to play than the soprano saxophone, and so it is a good choice for beginners. 
      A simple comparison of the length of the soprano and alto saxophones shows that they are about the same, 70 centimeters long.
