      <p class="tenortext"><b> The tenor saxophone is a medium-sized member of the saxophone family, a group of instruments invented by 
          Adolphe Sax in the 1840s. The tenor and the alto are the two most commonly used saxophones. The tenor is pitched in the key of
           B♭ (while the alto is pitched in the key of E♭). The tenor saxophone, like all saxophones, consists of an approximately 
           conical tube of thin brass, a type of metal. The wider end of the tube is flared slightly to form a bell, while the narrower
            end is connected to a single reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet.

    <p class="tenortext"><b> The tenor saxophone is the one most closely associated with jazz players, as it is a mainstay in that 
      genre. It is tuned to Bb and has the familiar, curved body style. Since it is not as large or heavy as the baritone or bass sax, 
      the tenor is somewhat easier for young beginners to play.</b></p>
